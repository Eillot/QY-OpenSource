支持滚动时Item淡入淡出，平移，缩放效果的ScrollView.
在滚动页面时，网页上的部件会逐渐褪色、平移或者缩放。
Regularly, I am pleasantly surprised by websites using a pattern I called the discrollver pattern. I'm sure you already know what I'm talking about but if not, http://vimeo.com/player is a good example. When you scroll, widgets appear from nowhere by fade, translation or scale.

With DiscrollView, I wanted to import this pattern on Android. This is an 0.0.1 alpha version because you have to do all the transformation work (fade, translation, scale etc) yourself base on a ratio value. I'm going to add some transformation presets (translation from left to right + fade in for example) to make the library more ready to use for lazy developers.
