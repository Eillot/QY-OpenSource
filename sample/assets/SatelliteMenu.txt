点击主按钮，会弹出多个围绕着主按钮排列的子按钮，从而形成一个弹出式菜单。子按钮弹出和消失的动画效果都很棒。这种弹出式菜单按钮应用在Path app中。

'Path' has a very attractive menu sitting on the left bottom corner of the screen. Satellite Menu is the open version of this menu.

For the ones who didnt see path, the menu consists of a main button on the left bottom of the screen. When the user clicks on this button, a number of buttons are popped out of this button. I have resembled this structure to a planet and satellites and thats why I gave the name of this project.

The menu uses built-in animations of Android platform.

Works in API Level 7 (2.1) and above.
